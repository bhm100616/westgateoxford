We\u2019re not sure what their timing is going to be. We\u2019re figuring it out as we go,\u201d said Dave Williams, the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. \u201cBut we\u2019ll make our preparations to convert to a caucus while this is all playing out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it [a Supreme Court ruling] does not go in our favor, we\u2019ll plan to do a caucus. But if it does go in our favor, then nothing will change,\u201d Williams added.<\/p>\n<p>In emails and phone calls, other state and national GOP officials indicated that making the switch would be tricky and contingent on several dynamics that, for the time being, are unclear.<\/p>\n<p>The first step, Williams and others explained, would be for the Colorado GOP to request a waiver from the Republican National Committee that would allow the state party to award delegates based on the results of a caucus system, not a primary election.<\/p>\n<p>In October, the Republican National Committee had approved plans from all 50 state parties about how they would hold their nominating contest and award delegates for the national nominating convention in July 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Williams predicted that he and other Colorado GOP officials would, \u201clikely in the next week or two\u201d approach the RNC to \u201cstart the process of obtaining a waiver in the event that the U.S. Supreme Court doesn\u2019t rule in our favor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said the process would be made easier by the fact that the Colorado state party had in September, \u201cembedded\u201d in its plan to the RNC a \u201ccontingency&#8221; in the event that Trump were to be removed from the ballot that essentially \u201cgave notice that we could ask for a waiver to convert from the primary system to caucus system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>RNC\u00a0rules\u00a0dictate that such a waiver can be granted to a state Republican Party in cases where the national committee determines that doing so \u201cis in the best interests of the Republican Party&#8221; or when it&#8217;s &#8220;not possible for a state Republican Party to hold the electing, selection, allocation, or binding of delegates to the national convention in accordance with the process(es) certified to the Republican National Committee.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The RNC\u2019s executive committee, which would vote on such a waiver, is next scheduled to meet at its winter meeting in Las Vegas at the end of January.<\/p>\n<p>Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that\u00a0Trump\u2019s candidacy in the state\u2019s primary next year\u00a0is prohibited\u00a0on\u00a0constitutional\u00a0grounds because he engaged in insurrection by inciting a riot on Jan. 6, 2021. The first-of-its kind ruling stems from a lawsuit that focused on a little-known provision in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Similar challenges in other states have proven unsuccessful.<\/p>\n<p>In its opinion, the court explicitly stated that Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold \u201cmay not list President Trump\u2019s name on the 2024 presidential primary ballot, nor may she count any write-in votes cast for him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The court put its decision on hold until Jan. 4 to allow for further appeals.<\/p>\n<p>It also said that if the matter reaches the U.S. Supreme Court before that date, the pause will remain in effect during that time and Colorado will be required to include Trump\u2019s name on the primary ballot pending action by the Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>The Trump campaign\u00a0has signaled that an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is imminent. As a result, the broader outcome will be mired in legal limbo for several weeks or months.<\/p>\n<p>The Colorado GOP nevertheless said it could begin the process of holding a caucus instead of a primary in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nDONALD TRUMPHere&#8217;s who has Trump&#8217;s ear as the\u00a0primary season kicks into full gear<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<\/p>\n<p>For decades, Colorado held caucuses as its nominating contests for presidential candidates. But in 2019, voters approved a measure that switched to a primary election system in presidential races, a change that was first implemented in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>But Colorado voters still caucus in contests for lower offices.<\/p>\n<p>Colorado\u2019s presidential primaries are currently scheduled for Tuesday, March 5. But state Republicans already have scheduled for\u00a0caucuses\u00a0across the state for other offices on March 7 explained Vera Ortegon, a Republican National Committeewoman from Colorado.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully, we will win the appeal to the Supreme Court, and his name will appear on the ballot. But if not then of course, we have a plan B \u2014 to elect the presidential candidate through the current caucus system,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>(Ortegon noted that there is an additional day of caucusing scheduled for March 9 for specific rural communities.)<\/p>\n<p>How exactly the party would take on expanding the existing statewide caucuses in such a narrow timeframe\u00a0remains unclear.<\/p>\n<p>But, if Republicans moved forward with switching to a caucus system, another likely hurdle would be any challenges to the changes from the Colorado Secretary of State\u2019s office.<\/p>\n<p>Williams said that, \u201cthe only thing we would [ask] of them is request that they not send out [Republican] primary ballots.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut if they refused us for whatever reason, then we\u2019d tell them \u2018OK, fine,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to ignore the results. We are not going to adhere to\u00a0 a system that has Donald Trump off that ballot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jack Todd, a spokesperson for Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, retorted that &#8220;Colorado law does not allow a presidential primary election to be cancelled at the request of a political party.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the Colorado Republican Party attempts to withdraw from the presidential primary or ignore the results of the election, this would likely be a matter for the courts,&#8221; Todd added.<\/p>\n<p>Todd declined to respond to questions about whether that meant Griswold&#8217;s office would file a suit to stop an effort by the state GOP to switch to a caucus, saying he &#8220;can\u2019t speak to hypothetical scenarios.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Griswold\u00a0told MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner\u00a0on\u00a0Tuesday night\u00a0that she \u201cwill follow whatever court order or decision is in place by the time of [ballot] certification.\u201d Griswold\u2019s deadline for ballot certification is Jan. 5.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the United States Supreme Court decides to take this case, I\u2019m sure that they will consider that certification in the state of Colorado is very quickly approaching and will issue an order or a decision quickly to make sure that we are in compliance with the law,\u201d Griswold said.<\/p>\n<p>Potentially further complicating the situation is that one of Trump&#8217;s opponents, Vivek Ramaswamy, has vowed to \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the GOP primary ballot in Colorado if Trump\u2019s name remains off the ballot and challenged the other candidates to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Former U.N. Ambassador\u00a0Nikki Haley, Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis\u00a0and former New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0all criticized the court\u2019s decision, arguing that judges should not play a role in the election process. But DeSantis said explicitly that he would not remove himself from the ballot in solidarity with Trump.<\/p>\n<p>All four have already met all\u00a0criteria\u00a0from the Colorado Secretary of State to appear on the primary ballot.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The prospective change to the state&#8217;s presidential nominating process would face major logistical and legal hurdles.
