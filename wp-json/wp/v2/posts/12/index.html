On Friday, he fielded query after query for long enough that the crowd, most of whom were not given chairs, thinned to about half its original size.<\/p>\n<p>The question DeSantis had the most difficulty answering is one that has confounded the rest of former President Donald Trump\u2019s rivals for the GOP nomination: \u201cWhat\u2019s your strategy to beat Trump?\u201d a man in the audience asked.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the thing, I think, like, you know, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself on these polls \u2014 in November of 2022, we were supposed to have this big red wave, and that crashed and burned. It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cYou look at the polls on my race, people said I was going to win, but a lot of them were like a week out, 5 points, 6 points. I won by 20.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He went on to contend that the media is propping up Trump, that President Joe Biden\u00a0might not be the Democratic nominee\u00a0and that \u201cnarrative\u201d will \u201ccollide with reality\u201d when Iowa voters caucus on Jan. 15.<\/p>\n<p>Trump leads with &#8216;outright majority&#8217; in Iowa caucuses, polling shows<br \/>\nDEC. 11, 202310:10<\/p>\n<p>But the reality here is the roughly 4,000 people who showed up to the University of New Hampshire\u2019s ice hockey arena Saturday to shower Trump with applause, scream their approval and affirm that they will vote for him in the Jan. 23 primary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe love you! We love you! We love you!\u201d the MAGA base chanted at Trump almost an hour into his remarks.<\/p>\n<p>They cheered when he promised, in a relatively new proposal, to \u201cindemnify all police officers\u201d against \u201cbeing destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions against crime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He even picked up some new support at a rally that was his biggest \u2014 and perhaps his last \u2014 of the year in the state. Chuck Morse, a gubernatorial candidate who lost his 2022 Senate primary after failing to gain Trump\u2019s endorsement, stood behind a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d-branded lectern before Trump arrived and pledged his loyalty to the former president.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to secure the northern and the southern borders. We need to get the economy back on track for working families hit hard by inflation. And we need to put America first when it comes to producing energy,\u201d he said of what he hears from voters across the state. \u201cWe can do all these things by putting Joe Biden back in his basement and getting Donald Trump back into the Oval Office.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The differences in energy and interest between Trump and the pack are evident across the state, echoing his\u00a0dominance in polls here.<\/p>\n<p>Attendees cheer during a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Durham, N.H., on Dec. 15.Reba Saldanha \/ AP<\/p>\n<p>When Gov. Chris Sununu, the most powerful elected Republican in the state,\u00a0endorsed\u00a0former United Nations Ambassador Nikki\u00a0Haley\u00a0earlier in the week, they drew between 200 and 300 supporters to a more modest venue in Manchester. For DeSantis and Haley, who are running second and third, respectively, in national polls, the most immediate challenge is to break away from each other.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin Butterworth, a semiretired 70-year-old from Manchester, saw DeSantis for the first time Friday night and liked what he heard.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nDONALD TRUMPHere&#8217;s who has Trump&#8217;s ear as the\u00a0primary season kicks into full gear<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very impressive,\u201d Butterworth, who wants to see Trump stopped in the primary, said of DeSantis. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing. If he was elected president, he would be a good president.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Butterworth, who went to Haley\u2019s event earlier in the week, said he isn\u2019t sold yet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s between Nikki and DeSantis,\u201d he said. \u201cI find both formidable as a replacement to what we have now and Trump. I mean, either one would do it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While anti-Trump Republicans are still trying to pick their horse, the former president has pivoted much of his rhetoric to the general election. Susie Wiles, senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said that his team will begin to focus more completely on the general election following the Super Tuesday primaries in March if all goes according to plan.<\/p>\n<p>She also said that because Trump may have to spend time off the trail in court beginning in March, the plan is to make that &#8220;not as critical a time by doing our jobs ahead of time and immediately after.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, Trump blamed Biden for everything from inflation to the Israel-Hamas war. And,\u00a0citing a comment\u00a0by Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said that it is Biden and Democrats \u2014 not him \u2014 who represent a threat to democracy almost three years after his backers stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to overturn his 2020 loss.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe talk about democracy,\u201d Trump said before alluding to the criminal charges he faces in four separate federal and state cases, \u201cbut the whole world is watching the persecution of a political opponent that\u2019s kicking his a&#8211;.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trump also had favorable comments for other autocratic leaders, pointing to Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s\u00a0praise for him\u00a0and saying that Kim Jong Un in North Korea is a \u201cnice\u201d person.<\/p>\n<p>Most polls show a close contest between Trump and Biden with nearly a year before Election Day.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Trump chided his Republican opponents enough to remind voters here that he still needs their help to win the primary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith Nikki, they talk about the surge, and with DeSanctimonious, the talk about the bounce,\u201d Trump said, using a nickname for DeSantis. \u201cThe only one that had a surge and the only one that had a bounce is Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He again called former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a \u201cfat pig.\u201d Christie is\u00a0running third, behind Haley and in front of DeSantis, in New Hampshire, but he has not campaigned in Iowa.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case with DeSantis, Trump worked against the clock. An hour into his speech, audience members began to file out of the arena. Twenty minutes later, as he spoke over music as if reciting lines for a campaign ad, little more than half the crowd remained. Trump kept going, and the hard-core faithful stuck around to the end.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTrump is going to kick a&#8211; and he\u2019s going to come back and fix everything,\u201d Effingham resident Stacy Brown, 55, said at the conclusion of what was her first Trump rally. \u201cI\u2019d have a hard time supporting anyone else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Several other attendees said in interviews with NBC News they have no interest in the other Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best candidate to rule this country,\u201d said Jackueline Chaves of Bedford. \u201cI think that the way he thinks, his attitude, he\u2019s just powerful, that\u2019s it.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley\u2019s events pale in comparison to Trump\u2019s raucous Saturday rally, as they continue to struggle with how to overtake the former president.
