The communities in which the Chronicle placed the monitors were adjacent to major refineries or chemical plants. The investigation found that residents in some of these areas were exposed to dangerous levels of cancer-causing pollutants.<\/p>\n<p>Cappiello, now communications director for\u00a0the Rocky Mountain Institute, said she often heard about air pollution accidents while reporting on the environment for the Chronicle. Her investigation started when she realized state standards didn\u2019t align with what she heard from residents who lived close to the industrial facilities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody was like \u2018nothing to see here,\u2019 but I was like something doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Cappiello said.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need a hundred sensors or even a year to find out more about your community\u2019s air quality, though. Checking for dangerous pollutants can start with simple records requests, including examples in the following guide focused on understanding and accessing air quality standards. We\u2019ll help you find public records about air pollution by focusing on three areas: standards, regulation and planning.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been reporting on\u00a0air pollution with Chicago-area partners including WBEZ, the Sun Times and Cicero Independiente, but these guides should be useful in communities across the United States. Future guides will focus on using public records to dig into how air safety regulation and planning processes work.<\/p>\n<p>Air pollution and local standards<\/p>\n<p>With so much information available, it can be hard to know where to start. Cappiello, a former\u00a0Society of Environmental Journalists\u00a0board member, said the first question about air pollution she would pose to her local government would be what the current standards are. Once you have that, Cappiello said, you can start questioning whether those standards are high enough and to what level of risk residents are exposed.<\/p>\n<p>Before you can understand your local government\u2019s standards on air pollution, you first have to find your local air pollution control board or air pollution branch of your state\u2019s environmental agency.<\/p>\n<p>After that, ask them where to find the documents below.<\/p>\n<p>Documents on air pollution to ask your local government for<br \/>\nAir pollution permits<\/p>\n<p>An air pollution permit\u00a0is a form that any facility emitting air pollutants is required to fill out, declaring what pollutants the facility will emit so that the state can ensure the facility meets federal and state air rules. Here\u2019s\u00a0how air permits are issued in Minnesota\u00a0and\u00a0examples of air permits issued by the state of Minnesota.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGo through the permits,\u201d Cappiello recommended. \u201cI spent so much time in the Houston field office for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality going through permits because, as they say, the devil is in the details.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re reviewing a permit, keep an eye out for what types of pollutants facilities emit, which can lead you to health consequences like the ones Cappiello highlighted in her investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Permits can also tell you the amount of pollutants emitted regularly and where the facility is located. If you\u2019re able to gather that permitting data across a whole town or city, you\u2019ll be able to spot whether there are inequities by neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Keith Matheny and Kristi Tanner of the Detroit Free Press\u00a0made use of air pollution permits from across the state of Michigan\u00a0to reveal the connection between where permits are approved and communities with long-standing racial and socioeconomic disparities. In Huntington, West Virginia, reporter Fred Pace at the Herald-Dispatch\u00a0dug up a recently submitted permit to tell its readers about the potential pollution\u00a0from a proposed steel mill.<\/p>\n<p>Annual air pollutant report<\/p>\n<p>This document is the annual self-reporting requirement for a facility that holds an air pollution permit.\u00a0Here\u2019s what the form for this report looks like in Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>There are several parts of these reports, often called emissions inventories, to pay close attention to. Sections about source emissions can also be useful because, similar to a permit, these parts of the form describe how much and what type of emissions the facility discloses for the reporting year.<\/p>\n<p>Sections on startups, shutdowns and malfunctions point towards excess emissions or other accidents at the facility in the past year.<\/p>\n<p>For inspiration on how to ask for this type of document, take a look at this request for\u00a0Illinois EPA\u2019s database of startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. You can\u00a0file this request yourself here, but be sure to update some of the state-specific language before filing.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0A Pass to Poison, Kiah Collier and Ryan Murphy analyzed data on thousands of self-reported emissions malfunctions across the state of Texas, documenting how the state lets polluters off the hook by charging polluters small fines for big problems.<\/p>\n<p>New source review permit<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew source review\u201d is a type of permit required when a facility makes any modifications\u00a0that would change its air pollution permit. Check out\u00a0the portal that Connecticut\u2019s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection maintains for air pollution permits\u00a0for an example of what your local government might record.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example request for\u00a0Illinois EPA\u2019s version of a new source review, a document called \u201cModification to a Clean Air Act Permit Program (CAAAP) Permit.\u201d\u00a0If you request something similar, make sure to update the language to reflect the state-specific filing and scope of information you are interested in.<\/p>\n<p>The new source review permit was one of Cappiello\u2019s favorite documents during her investigation. If you\u2019ve honed in on a specific facility, this document can explain how modifications to equipment have changed the facility\u2019s emissions over time. Cappiello suggests paying close attention to the uses of language like \u201ctune up\u201d that could downplay changes that cause larger capacity creep over time.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s next?<\/p>\n<p>A week after the Chronicle\u2019s investigation was published,\u00a0the mayor of Houston announced a new plan to track air pollution by installing monitors\u00a0on the fences of some of the area\u2019s industrial facilities. Later that year,\u00a0bills were introduced to the Texas House and Senate\u00a0calling for increased monitoring of air toxics.<\/p>\n<p>Cappiello\u2019s investigation started with a growing number of calls at her reporting desk from residents who were concerned that air pollution accidents weren\u2019t being properly reported.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was getting calls from residents all the time [about air pollution incidents],\u201d Cappiello said.<\/p>\n<p>In the next guide, we\u2019ll cover how your local government handles these kinds of complaints and, more generally, how local governments regulate air pollution.\u00a0Subscribe to MuckRock\u2019s weekly newsletter\u00a0to receive updates as they\u2019re published.
