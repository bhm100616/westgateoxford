That dynamic will inevitably start to affect Trump\u2019s messages and strategy, but it could also derail him and threaten his focus on the campaign trail.<\/p>\n<p>Trump has always liked to take counsel from a large network of people, for better or worse. And this campaign is no different.<\/p>\n<p>His management style \u201cpits people against each other, but he sits back and it\u2019s like entertainment for him,\u201d this person added. \u201cNo matter what the campaign wants or says, he likes the spectacle of people jockeying for his attention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Trump\u2019s success is due in part to his willingness to entertain a range of viewpoints, said Jason Miller, a spokesperson for the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe likes to get multiple opinions from people who have distinctly different perspectives, because far too often, political leaders will only get opinions from one side and only get opinions from people who have personal interest in how a decision plays out,\u201d Miller said. \u201cGetting input from a number of places and then coming to his own conclusion has always been one of his strengths as a leader.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether Trump enjoys playing people off against one another, Miller responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t speak so much to that. There was some talk that maybe that factored into the White House days, but I think that the difference here, and why you don\u2019t see the drama, is because President Trump knows whose opinions he values and he knows who he can trust.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Insiders<br \/>\nSusie Wiles, center, has been credited with instilling discipline into Trump and his band of loyalists.Jabin Botsford \/ The Washington Post via Getty Images file<\/p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign staffing has had far less drama than his earlier iterations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn years and cycles past, there\u2019s always been a level of infighting and trying to climb over one another to the top. That\u2019s not happening now,\u201d a source close to Trump said. \u201cWhile there are some frustrations with individuals at times, there\u2019s no alienation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in large part due to the figures at the center of the operation: Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who serve as de facto co-campaign managers; Miller, a veteran strategist; and longtime adviser Boris Epshteyn.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<br \/>\n2024 ELECTIONNevada GOP leaders indicted in pro-Trump \u2018fake elector\u2019 case still in charge of caucus planning<\/p>\n<p>Wiles, who used to be a top adviser to Florida Gov.

Santiago \/ Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>An overlooked part of the insiders\u2019 job is to help corral Trump\u2019s allies outside the campaign, without acting as gatekeepers who alienate supporters. They\u2019re a broad circle of loyalists \u2014 some of whom have been with Trump since the beginning \u2014 who once again have his ear.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the mix are Stephen Miller, the conservative policy aide who served in the White House, and Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s ousted former chief strategist, whose podcast has vaulted him to the center of the populist universe and back into Trump\u2019s graces.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former U.S. ambassador to Germany, who is often spotted on the road with him these days, and Kash Patel, a former top Defense Department official. Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News host whose prime-time polemics drew blockbuster ratings, is another influential voice.<\/p>\n<p>Patel, in response, told NBC News, \u201cPresident Trump surrounds himself with the brightest minds in the country and will bring back policies that will make our failing nation prosperous again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bannon has been using his streaming show, \u201cWar Room,\u201d to hint at what policies could come from a second term of a Trump administration.\u00a0Patel recently suggested\u00a0on Bannon\u2019s show that Trump could use the power of the federal government to target his political and media enemies.<\/p>\n<p>Bannon\u2019s show and the points he\u2019s making on it about a future Trump administration are being taken seriously by top Republican Party donors who are now regularly watching the program, believing that at least some of the things he\u2019s saying could happen if Trump regains power, according to a longtime party fundraiser.<\/p>\n<p>Miller, the mastermind behind some of Trump\u2019s most hard-line immigration policies, is working remotely with the policy and speechwriting teams, a source close to Trump said.<\/p>\n<p>Stephen Miller, the mastermind behind some of Trump&#8217;s most hard-line immigration policies, is back in the fold.Anna Moneymaker \/ Getty Images file<\/p>\n<p>Trump is also speaking regularly with his first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski,\u00a0who was ousted\u00a0just one month before the Republican Party\u2019s nominating convention in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>At a stop in New Hampshire this fall, Trump called out for Lewandowski to join him: \u201cWhere is Corey? Corey. Get over here, Corey. Come here, Corey. Give me Corey. I gotta get him up,\u201d Trump said, calling Lewandowski someone \u201cthat\u2019s been with me really from the beginning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another person back in the fold is Michael Caputo, a longtime Republican operative who has been paid at least $15,000 to be an adviser on the campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings.<\/p>\n<p>Caputo, who for years has been close to Trump and allies such as Roger Stone, has become a key policy adviser to Trump for his 2024 run for the White House, according to two sources briefed on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>During the Trump administration, Caputo was the top spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services. He\u00a0took a leave\u00a0of absence after he posted a social media rant accusing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists of \u201csedition\u201d and plotting \u201chow they\u2019re going to attack Donald Trump.\u201d Shortly after he took leave, his spokesman said Caputo had been diagnosed with cancer.<\/p>\n<p>For Trump, holding a circle of faithful outsiders at close range holds other advantages: If an idea combusts, \u201cthe campaign can distance itself, arguing, \u2018We never said it.\u2019 If it works, they take credit for it,\u201d a former adviser said, suggesting the tactic was akin to \u201crunning a campaign by proxy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While frustrations with some outside people surface at times, the campaign team does not feel it is to anyone\u2019s benefit to try to alienate them, said a source close to Trump.<\/p>\n<p>But still, there is extreme sensitivity to anyone\u2019s trying too hard to position themselves for jobs in a potential second Trump administration.<\/p>\n<p>Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t want people in Washington planning their office space\u201d for a future administration, his advisers say, and when people speculate about who could join his presidential ticket, \u201che shuts it down.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After NBC News asked the campaign about an ally \u2014 someone Trump has publicly praised \u2014 who is working behind the scenes on vetting candidates to join the ticket, an aide said anyone purporting to be involved \u201chas lost their damned mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A day later, the Trump campaign put out a statement publicly tearing into \u201cselfish efforts by \u2018desk hunters\u2019\u201d to try to secure plum jobs for themselves in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>After Trump lauded the person by name before a large crowd at a campaign rally, another source said, \u201cThat\u2019s Trump, not the campaign.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Washington crowd<\/p>\n<p>Despite the refusal to engage in the Washington parlor game of guessing at a Cabinet makeup, the planning for a possible return to the Oval Office is happening.<\/p>\n<p>Inside and outside the campaign are operatives and policy strategists thinking about how to see Trump\u2019s agenda through, with hires who can hit the ground running if he returns to the White House, said two advisers close to Trump who are not formally affiliated with the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Plans to implement policy objectives early on could become campaign arguments, this adviser said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe higher-level appointments aren\u2019t necessarily there yet,\u201d this person added. \u201cThey are working on structure \u2014 how to deliver \u2014 and not so much on Cabinet appointments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, \u201cif you raise a name, he\u2019s always interested in hearing about what you think,\u201d this source said of Trump. \u201cBut his view is that the transition occurs after the nomination is achieved; until then, every ounce of energy is focused on that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Continuing to advise Trump are former officials with long government r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, such as Grenell, Robert Lighthizer, Robert O\u2019Brien, Mike Pompeo, John Ratcliffe and Russ Vought, this adviser said. Larry Kudlow, Stephen Moore and Newt Gingrich also\u00a0remain close\u00a0to him.<\/p>\n<p>Some have found roles at the America First Policy Institute or the Heritage Foundation, two think tanks populated by former Trump officials that are now dueling for influence in Washington.<\/p>\n<p>But even with a Senate map poised to prove favorable for Republicans in 2024, roadblocks are expected, with a former top Trump military appointee predicting \u201cblood sport\u201d confirmations to muscle Trump\u2019s nominees through.<\/p>\n<p>Allies see plenty of opportunity to reshape the government even before Trump\u2019s picks make it before the Senate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit by the next time around and wait for the Senate,\u201d said a former Trump administration official closely involved in the planning for the next Republican White House. \u201cIn a perfect world, you nominate highly qualified, very conservative candidates to be in leadership positions throughout the federal government, not just at the secretary level, but all the way down. But the plans we are making are not contingent on a swift confirmation of people at the secretary level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trump White House and administration veterans advised looking to the final months of Trump\u2019s administration for a picture of where his priorities and staffing would begin to pick up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe president has learned his lesson to count on people he would trust,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to re-create the wheel.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The former president has always had a sprawling group of loyalists and outside advisers, many of whom are increasingly coming back into the fold.
