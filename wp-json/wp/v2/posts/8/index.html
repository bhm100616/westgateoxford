In her order Wednesday, Howell reduced the verdict by roughly $2 million to reflect damages the pair were paid in a\u00a0settlement\u00a0last year\u00a0with the other defendant in the case, the TV network OAN.<\/p>\n<p>Giuliani had argued that Howell should not &#8220;abnormally shorten&#8221; the automatic 30-day stay after the verdict, but she wrote that under the circumstances of the case, &#8220;there is nothing &#8216;abnormal&#8217; about plaintiffs\u2019 request&#8221; and it was &#8220;appropriate and warranted&#8221; given Giuliani&#8217;s behavior in the case.<\/p>\n<p>Howell found Giuliani liable as a punishment for repeatedly\u00a0snubbing court orders\u00a0requiring him to turn over evidence \u2014 including evidence about his finances \u2014 to Freeman and Moss. He also ignored orders that he pay their attorneys over $200,000 in legal fees for trying to enforce the orders.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Giuliani cannot and does not dispute that he has continued to disregard the Court\u2019s orders directing payment of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 successful discovery motions,&#8221; Howell wrote.<\/p>\n<p>She also cited Freeman and Moss&#8217; concerns that &#8220;Giuliani has numerous and mounting debts&#8221; but indicated she was skeptical that he is as broke as he has portrayed himself to be because of his &#8220;persistent refusal&#8221; to turn over his financial information.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nDONALD TRUMPHere&#8217;s who has Trump&#8217;s ear as the\u00a0primary season kicks into full gear<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Such claims of Giuliani\u2019s &#8216;financial difficulties&#8217;\u2014no matter how many times repeated or publicly disseminated and duly reported in the media\u2014are difficult to square with the fact that Giuliani affords a spokesperson, who accompanied him daily to trial,&#8221; Howell noted, and \u201cGiuliani has failed to show that he cannot pay the [amount] he owes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Giuliani&#8217;s spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.<\/p>\n<p>Giuliani has called the size of the verdict &#8220;absurd.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Giuliani sued again by Georgia election workers for remarks after verdict<br \/>\nDEC. 19, 202303:25<\/p>\n<p>In her order Wednesday, Howell wrote that she did not consider the amount excessive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The amount of compensatory damages for defamation awarded by the jury was nearly $10,000,000 less than the amount requested by plaintiffs for reputational harm,&#8221; she noted, while also pointing out the jury&#8217;s $75 million award for punitive damages was much less than it could have been.<\/p>\n<p>It was roughly the same total amount the pair had been awarded for reputational and emotional harm, and the jury had been instructed that it could multiply that amount by four if it thought it was necessary, Howell pointed out.<\/p>\n<p>Giuliani still can appeal the judgment but would need to post a bond of the full amount owed to Freeman and Moss \u2014 $146 million.
